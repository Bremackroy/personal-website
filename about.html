                I'm a career-changing Fullstack Developer passionate about crafting intuitive web experiences. With a background in Project Management, I bring a unique perspective to software development, blending creativity with analytical thinking.
                My journey into tech began with my love for technology and learning new products. Since then, I've immersed myself in learning, graduating from Fullstack Academy and building a foundation in CSS, HTML, and API integration. I thrive in collaborative settings, leveraging my [previous career] experience to bring a fresh approach to problem-solving.
                Outside of coding, I'm dedicated to improving my skills in golf and exploring new opportunities to apply my talents in government contracts and crisis management. I'm excited to continue growing in this dynamic field and contribute to impactful projects.
